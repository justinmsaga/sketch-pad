                17 year old me (who moving forward will be referred to as
                bushsk8r) wanted to be the next
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey"
                    >Adrian Newey</a
                >.
            </p>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel"
                    >Vettel</a
                >
                was the next
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher"
                    >Schumacher</a
                >
                bushsk8r was too old to aspire to be a driver so the
                next best thing was to design the car.

                life happened between then and now so here we are on the detour
                of my f1 journey running purely on "vibes"
            </p>

            <p>
                the core of what bushsk8r wanted was a space to make
                things which others can use to be the best at what they do. I was
                intrigued by craftsmanship
